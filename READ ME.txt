Chris, 

This file contains a list of all the files within the "oxy" folder in my GitHub where I've put all my files.

I've tried to jot down here a quick summary of what each thing does / is to help you and future students sort through everything.

"6-11-15 Research Meeting Notes.docx" - These were some notes that I took during the first meeting that I attended in the summer with the U-o-R group.

"Complete_Drug_Triangle_Users.txt" - This is an output file from "drug_connections.py" which contains a list of all of the users who were flagged as tweeting about drugs, and also are in a reciprocal triangle with two other users who also tweeted about drugs.

"Complete_Oxy_Nonrecip_Triangle_Users.txt" - This is an output file from "oxycontin_connections.py" which contains a list of all of the users who were flagged as tweeting about oxycodone, and also are in a non-reciprocal triangle with two other users who also tweeted about oxycodone.

"Complete_Oxy_Triangle_Users.txt" - This is an output file from "oxycontin_connections.py" which contains a list of all of the users who were flagged as tweeting about oxycodone, and also are in a reciprocal triangle with two other users who also tweeted about oxycodone.

"Drug_13-2015_Gephi.JPG" - This is a screenshot of the gephi file "Drug_Social_Graph_Visual_Test2.gephi" for the connections between those tweeting about drugs, based on the "13-2015_social_graph.json" graph file and the "1year_filtered.json" tweet file. The connections are found using the "drug_connections.py" file.

"drug_complete_triangle_connections.py" - This program finds the connections between those tweeting about drug, but only between those who were already found by "drug_connections.py" to be in a reciprocal triangle with two other users who also tweeted about drugs, which are stored in "Complete_Drug_Triangle_Users.txt" .

"Drug_Complete_Triangle_Visual_Test.gephi" - This is the gephi file for the connections found by "drug_complete_triangle_connections.py" for users tweeting about drugs who are also in a reciprocal triangle with two other users who also tweeted about drugs.

"Drug_Complete_Triangle_Visual_Test.gephi_temp" - This is a backup file created by gephi that is associated with "Drug_Complete_Triangle_Visual_Test.gephi".

"Drug_Complete_Tris_Edges.csv" - This is a csv version of "Drug_Complete_Tris_Edges.txt" which was used with gephi to create "Drug_Complete_Triangle_Visual_Test.gephi".

"Drug_Complete_Tris_Edges.txt" - This file contains a list of the edges for connections between users tweeting about drugs who are also in a reciprocal triangle with two other users who also tweeted about drugs, and is generated by "drug_complete_triangle_connections.py".

"Drug_Complete_Tris_Nodes.txt" - This file contains a list of the nodes for the users tweeting about drugs who are also in a reciprocal triangle with two other users who also tweeted about drugs, and is generated by "drug_complete_triangle_connections.py".

"drug_connections.py" - This program finds all the connections between those that were tweeting about drugs, who were found by "drug_tweet_searcher.py" and are listed in "Flagged_Drug_Users.txt".

"Drug_Connections.txt" - This is a file created by "drug_connections.py", but it isn't really used for anything.

"Drug_Full_Tris_13-2015_Gephi.JPG" - This is a screenshot of the gephi file "Drug_Complete_Triangle_Visual_Test.gephi" for the connections between those tweeting about drugs, and in a reciprocal triangle with two other users who also tweeted about drugs, based on the "13-2015_social_graph.json" graph file and the "1year_filtered.json" tweet file. The connections are found using the "drug_connections.py" file.
